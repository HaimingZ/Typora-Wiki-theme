# Typora-Wiki-theme

## Introduction

- This is a typora theme inspired by [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). 
- The following styles were set based on Wikipedia website: header1 to 3, passage, toc, quote, image, hyperlink, code, table. While other styles were not.

- Only tested on Windows 10.

## Highlights

- The code in `css` file was reduced and structured. Necessary comments were added. As a result, this theme can be easily modified by people who are not familiar with `HTML` and `CSS` (Just like me).
